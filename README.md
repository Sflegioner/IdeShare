This separation (e.g. client/ vs. server/) makes it easy to develop and deploy each part. You would run the React app in client/ and the Express API in server/, communicating via HTTP requests.
Installation and Setup
To set up IdeShare locally, follow these steps:
Clone the repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/Sflegioner/IdeShare.git
cd IdeShare
Install dependencies:
Navigate to the project root and install both frontend and backend packages. For example, if using npm for Node.js:
bash

npm install
This installs dependencies listed in package.json. (If the project uses Yarn, you’d run yarn install.)
Configure environment:
Create a .env file in the project root (or server/ directory) to set environment variables. For example, you might specify the MongoDB connection URI and a JWT secret:
ini

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/ideshare
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
Adjust these variables as needed for your local setup.
Run the application:
Start the backend server and frontend client. In one terminal, you might run:
bash
Копіювати
Редагувати
npm start      # starts the Express server (for example, on localhost:3001)
In another terminal, run:
bash

npm run client # or similar, to start the React development server (e.g. localhost:3000)
(Alternatively, a single command like npm run dev could start both if configured.)
Access the app:
Open your browser to the specified local address (e.g., http://localhost:3000). You should see the IdeShare interface. You can now register a user, post ideas, and test the collaboration flow.
